* Attempting to simulate the SBML model provided in Villaverde et al. resulted in numerical integration failure in both COPASI and libRoadRunner. However, the COPASI native version of this model (b1.cps) did not exhibit numerical problems. Hence, we exported the COPASI native version to SBML and used this instead. We also renamed the user-defined function `max` to `mymax` because the former is reserved for a built-in function in modern versions of libSBML.
